Description: Import the logging library.
        
            import repsci
        
        Create an experiment. A unique directory will be created with the experiment
        name, a timestamp, and the current git hash.
        
            exp_name = "hello_world"
            exp = repsci.Experiment(exp_name)
        
        Get the logger and write a log message.
        
            log = exp.get_logger()
            log.debug("Hello, World!")
        
        Create an output file in the unique output directory.
        
            filename = exp.get_filename('output.csv')
            with open(filename, "wb") as f:
                f.write("Hello, World\n")
        
        The state of python's random number generator is stored in `random_state.bin`
        in pickle format. This state can be used to reproduce the output of randomized
        scripts.
                
        The Experiment constructor also has some optional parameters:
        * `config`: a configparser object, which will exported to the output directory.
        * `output_dir`: the subdirectory of the current directory to place experiment directories in.
        * `suffix`: a string to append to the end of the trial's directory.
        
        Create an experiment from a previous experiment's unique directory.
        
            exp_name = "hello_world"
            timestamp = "2020-09-09 152600"
            exp = repsci.Experiment(exp_name, reproduce=timestamp)
            
        Get the config from the prevous experiment.
        
            config = exp.get_config()
